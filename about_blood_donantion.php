                    <h4>About an hour of your time could change someone’s life.</h4>
                    <p><strong>"A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions
                            and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of
                            whole blood into its components (Plasma, Red blood cells, White blood cells,
                            Platelets))"</strong>.<br>Blood donation is a safe and simple four-step process:

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p><strong>Charles Richard Drew </strong>(1904–1950) was an American surgeon and medical researcher. He
                        researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and
                        applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II.<br> This
                        allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces.

                    <h2>Types of Donations</h2>
                    Blood donations are divided into groups based on who will receive the collected blood.
                    <ul>
                        <li> An <strong>'allogeneic' (also called 'homologous') donation</strong> is when a donor gives blood for <strong>storage at a blood bank</strong> for transfusion to an <strong>unknown recipient</strong>.</li>
                        <li> A <strong>'directed' donation</strong> is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for
                            <strong>transfusion to a specific individual</strong>. Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists.
                        </li>
                        <li> A <strong>'replacement donor'</strong> donation is a hybrid of the two and is common in developing countries. In this case, a friend or family member of the recipient <strong>donates blood to replace the stored blood used in a transfusion</strong>, ensuring a consistent supply. When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an <strong>'autologous donation'</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Blood that is used to make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively
                    used for manufacturing.<br>
                    An event where donors come to <strong>donate allogeneic blood</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>'Blood Donation Campaign' </strong>. These can occur at a blood bank, but they are often set up at a location in the community such as a shopping center, workplace, school, or house of worship.

                <div class="sub_container">
                    <h2>Whole blood</h2>
                    The most common method is collecting the blood from the donor's vein into a container. <strong>The amount of blood drawn </strong>varies from 200 millilitres to 550 millilitres depending on the country, but <strong>400 millilitres is typical in India</strong>.<br> The blood is usually <strong>stored in a flexible plastic bag that also contains sodium citrate, phosphate, dextrose, and adenine. This combination keeps the blood from clotting and preserves it during storage up to 42 days</strong>. Other chemicals are sometimes added during processing.
                </div><br>
                <div class="sub_container">
                    <ul>
                        <h2>Blood Tests</h2>
                        The donor's blood type must be determined if the blood will be used for transfusions.<br> The collecting agency usually identifies whether the blood is type A, B, AB, or O and the donor's Rh (D) type and will screen for antibodies to less common antigens. More testing, including a crossmatch, is usually done before a transfusion.<br><strong>Type O negative is often cited as the "universal donor" but this only refers to red cell and whole blood transfusions. For plasma and platelet transfusions the system is reversed: AB positive is the universal platelet donor type while both AB positive and AB negative are universal plasma donor types.</strong><br>
                        Most blood is tested for diseases, including some STDs. The tests used are high-sensitivity
                        screening tests and no actual diagnosis is made. Some of the test results are later found to be false
                        positives using more specific testing. False negatives are rare, but donors are discouraged from
                        using blood donation for the purpose of anonymous STD screening because a false negative could mean a
                        contaminated unit. The blood is usually discarded if these tests are positive, but there are some
                        exceptions, such as autologous donations. The donor is generally notified of the test result.<br>
                        Donated blood is tested by many methods, but the <strong>core tests</strong> recommended by the World Health Organization are these four:<strong> Hepatitis B surface antigen Antibody to hepatitis C Antibody to HIV, usually subtypes 1 and 2 Serologic test for syphilis</strong><br>
                        The WHO reported in 2006 that 56 out of 124 countries surveyed did not use these basic tests on all
                        blood donations.

                        A variety of other tests for transfusion transmitted infections are often used based on local
                        requirements. Additional testing is expensive, and in some cases the tests are not implemented because
                        of the cost. These additional tests include other infectious diseases such as West Nile fever
                        and babesiosis. Sometimes multiple tests are used for a single disease to cover the limitations of
                        each test. For example, the HIV antibody test will not detect a recently infected donor, so some blood
                        banks use a p24 antigen or HIV nucleic acid test in addition to the basic antibody test to detect
                        infected donors. Cytomegalovirus is a special case in donor testing in that many donors will test
                        positive for it. The virus is not a hazard to a healthy recipient, but it can harm infants and
                        other recipients with weak immune systems.

                <div class="sub_container">
                    <h2>Recovery and time between donations</h2>
                    Donors are usually kept at the donation site for 10–15 minutes after donating since most adverse reactions
                    take place during or immediately after the donation. Blood centers typically provide light refreshments,
                    such as orange juice and cookies, or a lunch allowance to help the donor recover.<br> The needle site is
                    covered with a bandage and the donor is directed to keep the bandage on for several hours. In hot
                    climates, donors are advised to avoid dehydration (strenuous exercise and games, alcohol) until a few hours
                    after donation.

                    Donated plasma is replaced after 2–3 days.<br> Red blood cells are replaced by bone marrow into the
                    circulatory system at a slower rate, on average 36 days in healthy adult males.<br>

                    Plasmapheresis and plateletpheresis donors can donate much more frequently because they do not lose
                    significant amounts of red cells.<br> The exact rate of how often a donor can donate differs from country to
                    country. <br>For example, plasmapheresis donors in the United States are allowed to donate large volumes twice a
                    week and could nominally donate 83 litres (about 22 gallons) in a year, whereas the same donor in Japan may
                    only donate every other week and could only donate about 16 litres (about 4 gallons) in a year.
                    <br>Whole Blood Donation can be done after 3 months of previous Donation<br>

                    Iron supplementation decreases the rates of donor deferral due to low hemoglobin, both at the first donation
                    visit and at subsequent donations. Iron-supplemented donors have higher hemoglobin and iron stores. On the
                    other hand, iron supplementation frequently causes diarrhea, constipation and epigastric abdominal
                    discomfort. The long-term effects of iron supplementation without measurement of iron stores are unknown.

                    <h2>Donor health benefits</h2>
                    In patients prone to iron overload, blood donation prevents the accumulation of toxic quantities.
                    Donating blood may reduce the risk of heart disease for mens.<br>

                    Research published in 2012 demonstrated that in patients with metabolic syndrome, repeated blood donation is
                    effective in reducing blood pressure, blood glucose, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein
                    ratio, and heart rate.<br>

                    A study published in JAMA Network Open tracked PFAS levels in a clinical trial and showed that regular blood
                    or plasma donations resulted in a significant reduction in PFAS levels for the participants.

                    <h2> Donation levels/Facts</h2>

                    The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes World Blood Donor Day on 14 June each year to promote blood
                    donation. This is the birthday of Karl Landsteiner, the scientist who discovered the ABO blood group
                    system.<br> The theme of the 2012 World Blood Donor Day campaign, "Every blood donor is a hero" focuses on
                    the idea that everyone can become a hero by giving blood. <br>
                    Every year, 14.6 million units of blood are required in India. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India suffers from an annual deficit of 2 million blood units, as only 1% of the Indian population donates blood each year. In 2020, which was a COVID year, 12.7 million units of blood were donated.

                    <h2> Storage and blood shelf life</h2>
                    The collected blood is usually stored in a blood bank as separate components, and some of these have short
                    shelf lives. <ul>
                        <li>The longest shelf life used for <strong>platelets</strong> is <strong>seven days</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Red blood cells (RBC)</strong>,
                            the most frequently used component, have a shelf life of <strong>35–42 days</strong> at refrigerated temperatures. For
                            (relatively rare) long-term storage applications, this can be extended by freezing the blood with a mixture
                            of glycerol, but this process is expensive and requires an extremely cold freezer for storage.</li>
                        <li><strong> Plasma</strong> can be
                            stored frozen for an extended period of time and is typically given an expiration date of <strong>one year</strong> and maintaining a supply is less of a problem.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div><br>
                <div class="sub_container">
                    <h2>Demand for blood</h2>
                    India requires approximately 1.45 crore units of blood annually. This blood is collected through 3,500 licensed blood banks across the country.<br>
                    One type of
                    blood being in stock does not guarantee that another type is. Blood banks may have some units in stock but
                    lack others, ultimately causing the patients that need units for specific blood types to have delayed or
                    canceled procedures.<br> Additionally, every year there is an increase of around 5-7% for transfusions
                    without an increase of donors to balance it as well as a growing population of elderly people that will need
                    more transfusions in the future without a predicted increase in donations to reflect those growing
                    numbers.<br>
                    Blood donations tend to always be high in demand with numerous accounts repeatedly stating periodic
                    shortages over the decades. The limited storage time means that it is difficult to have a stockpile of blood to prepare for a disaster.
