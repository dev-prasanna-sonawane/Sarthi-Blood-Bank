                    <h2>Blood Donation Process</h2>
                    <h4>About an hour of your time could change someone’s life.</h4>
                    <p><strong>"A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions
                            and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of
                            whole blood into its components (Plasma, Red blood cells, White blood cells,
                            Platelets))"</strong>.<br>
                        When donating blood, the standard donation is approximately 450 mL, slightly less than half a litre
                        or two cups. This represents a small portion of the blood in a person’s body, as the average adult
                        has about 5 litres.<br> The entire process takes just over half an hour but the actual blood
                        donation takes less than <strong>10-12 minutes</strong>

                        <li><strong>Hydration is Key :</strong> Staying well-hydrated before your donation is crucial. Proper
                            hydration
                            ensures a smooth blood flow and helps you feel comfortable during the process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nourish Your Body :</strong> Consume iron-rich foods in the days leading up to your
                            donation. Leafy
                            greens, lean meats, and legumes are excellent choices that enhance the quality of your donated
                            blood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prioritize Rest :</strong> A good night's sleep prior to your donation is essential.
                            Being well-rested
                            contributes to a successful and positive donation experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Honesty is Essential :</strong> Inform the medical staff about any medications you’re
                            taking. Transparency
                            about your health helps maintain the safety of both the donor and the recipient.You will
                            complete a questionnaire.</li>

                    <h2>Dont's Before Blood Donation?</h2>
                    <ul type="bullet">
                        <li><strong> Never Skip Meals :</strong> Donating blood on an empty stomach is discouraged. Proper
                            nutrition provides
                            the
                            energy needed for the donation and helps prevent fatigue and dizziness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Alcohol :</strong> Refrain from consuming alcohol at least 24 hours before
                            donating. Alcohol can
                            dehydrate your body, affecting the quality of your blood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Say No to Smoking :</strong> Smoking immediately before donating can impact your blood's
                            oxygen-carrying
                            capacity. It's best to avoid smoking on the day of your donation.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Prioritize Health :</strong> If you're unwell or recovering from an illness, postpone
                            your donation until
                            you're fully recovered. This ensures both your well-being and the safety of the recipient.</li>

                        <li><strong> Stay Calm and Relaxed :</strong> Practice deep breathing or meditation techniques to
                            stay calm and
                            composed.
                            A relaxed state of mind contributes to a positive donation experience.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Give Yourself Time :</strong> Allocate sufficient time for the donation process. Rushing
                            can elevate
                            stress
                            levels and negatively affect your donation experience.</li>
                        <li> Talk to a staff member if you feel uncomfortable or worried.</li>
